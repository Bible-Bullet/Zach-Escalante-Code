# Zach-Escalante-Code
Hi - welcome to my personal github page! This represents various projects and code that I've written. My code touches on different applications pertaining to Python.

I've recently been creating several tutorials related to webscraping in Beautifulsoup, Selenium and Scrapy. Additionally I'm also working on updating my Intro to Python notes which I used to teach introductory Python lectures. I'm happy to hear your thoughts and suggestions for how I can better this material and make it both more readable and user-friendly!

Please feel free to survey and provide feedback on my code! Expect more to be added in the near future.

Thanks,
Zach
