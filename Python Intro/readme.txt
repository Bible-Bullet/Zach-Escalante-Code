\f0\fs24 \cf0 Welcome to this Python Intro! \
\
I\'92ve recently had to start documenting some Python basics for data analysis and wanted to share this with anyone interested. By no means is this a completely comprehensive overview, rather a synopsis with some helpful code and links for you to both start practicing and research in more depth. I\'92ll be updating this file as I have time with more helpful code snippets!\
\
I\'92ve written this using Python 3, so if you\'92re using Python 2 you\'92ll have to adjust the print statements, but otherwise it should run just the same! \
\
Please let me know any helpful comments or suggestions. Look forward to hearing your feedback!}
