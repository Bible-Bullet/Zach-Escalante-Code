Welcome to this Python Intro!

Ive recently had to start documenting some Python basics for data analysis and wanted to share this with anyone interested. By no means is this a completely comprehensive overview, rather a synopsis with some helpful code and links for you to both start practicing and research in more depth. I'll be updating this file as I have time with more helpful code snippets!

I'92ve written this using Python 3, so if you're using Python 2 you'll have to adjust the print statements, but otherwise it should run just the same!

Please let me know any helpful comments or suggestions. Look forward to hearing your feedback!
